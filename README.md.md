## Introduction
1. Git is the most popular Version Control System.
2. A Version Control System records the changes we make to code base in a database called a repository.
3. Through history we can easily debug/restore our system to a previous state.
4. There are two types of Version Control Systems, Centralized and Distributed.
5. Centralized has one local server to push and pull from.
6. Examples of this include Subversion and Microsoft Team Foundation Server.
7. Single point of failure
8. In Distributed systems we store a local copy of the project as a snapshot. If the central server is down we can synchronize our work through this.
9. Examples include Git and Mercurial.
