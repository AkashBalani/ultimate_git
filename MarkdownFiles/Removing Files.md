1. Removing files doesn't remove them from the staging area.
2. To view the files in the staging area use this command.
``` shell
git ls-files
```
3. If you want to bypass this deleting from working directory and then staging area you can type in the following command.
``` shell
git rm file1.txt # Similar to add can add multiple files and patterns.
```
