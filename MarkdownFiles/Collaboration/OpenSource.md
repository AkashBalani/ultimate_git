1. You need to fork a repo to your github server.
2. You then need to clone that repository.
3. After that usually you want to create a branch and then work on that.
4. Then you push the branch on your forked repo with this command.
``` shell
git push -u origin <branchName>
```
5. Then you can create a pull request to put your code into the main source code.
6. Once the pull request has been created you can talk over it and then you can either merge it on github or through command line.
