1. Think of it this way, quite often we want others to review our code, in such a case we can make use of a Pull Request.
2. With a Pull Request, you can are opening a discussion area about merging the code.
3. It's very easy to raise a pull request in github.
4. Once the pull request has been raised it can be review reworked and then changes can be pushed and merge the branch.
5. After that prune the branch on local and delete it.
